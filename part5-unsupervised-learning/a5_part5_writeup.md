After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
    Top left - Financially irresponsible - not much expendable income but they still do, probably against better judgement
    Top right - Big Bucks Spender - have a large amount of expendable income and they use it for sure
    Middle - Balanced Individual - have a stable income and don't spend too much
    Bottom left - Rightfully Financially Careful - less than comfortable income and have a tight wallet because of it
    Bottom right - Wealthy frugal - make lots of money but still decide to cut down on excessive spending

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
    A customer who has a medium income and low spending habits would be in the middle group.

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
    The marketing team might approach the bottom left cluster customer group by investing in products which are durable yet affordable. For instance, a cheaper vaccuum might entice a lower-income individual who is more frugal and recognizes the value of having high quality appliances for daily use.
